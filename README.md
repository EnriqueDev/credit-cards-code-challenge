## Introduction and challenge description

Thank you for taking the time to take a look into this challenge! The goal of this challenge is to design a frontend application for a credit card elegibility program.

The application will collect the data with a form, then it will validate it and make a request to an API (read Before running this project section). Finally the available cards for a user will be displayed in a second screen, with the ability to select one or more cards and then show how much credit would be available with the selected options.
